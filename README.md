# Code Wars Practice

Part of growing as a programmer is to practice, practice, practice. Throughout this course, there will be weekly Code Wars challenges. You are also expected to complete 10 pts (aka honor) worth of kata each week. The weekly challenge will be posted Monday morning and will be due by Friday night.

Note: You can see how much honor you have in the top right corner, or in your profile.

Also note, Kata are worth honor points based on difficulty:
- Completed Kata (White):	2	
- Completed Kata (Yellow): 8
- Completed Kata (Blue): 32
- Completed Kata (Purple): 128

### Weekly Challenges
The links to each week's challenge will be posted in the [WEEKLY_CHALLENGE](WEEKLY_CHALLENGE.md) file every Monday.

### Submitting your Solutions
Create a repo to hold the solutions for each of the weekly challenges you solve. Having this repo will allow us to easily view your work, as well as make it easy for you to refer back to your solutions in the future! Talking about how you solved challenges like Kata are great dev ice breakers or interview story prompts. Feel free to add any other solutions you work on, as well, but note that they do not have to be submitted via PR.

Create a new branch for each Kata you solve; name the branch after the kata. On that branch, add a file named after the Kata as well: for example, `object-oriented-piracy.js`. Within the file itself, add a comment with a link to the Kata.

Your repo should also have a README with information about the overall purpose of your repo.

To submit your weekly Code Wars solutions:
1. To submit your solution, make a PR to your master branch.
1. In Canvas, submit the URL to the PR and a screenshot of your profile with your current total number of points (aka honor).
